Lecture slides for the International Trade course that I taught with Scott Orr in the summer term of 2016. They cover the Ricardian, Hecksher-Ohlin, and the Specific Factors model of trade.

I used the Beamer class in Lyx to create the slides and OmniGraffle Pro to create the figures. The pdf copies of the slides are in the `palermo-trade-slides` folder.

The slides are heavily revised versions of the slides of the previous instructors of the course (Mengxiao Liu and Christian Dippel).
